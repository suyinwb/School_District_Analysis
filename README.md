School District Analysis

## Background
Maria, chief data scientist is responsible for analysing district schools tests data for students performance trends and patterns. These insights are used for informed decisions at the school and district levels. For this we are looking at the dataset to get an understanding of student fundings and standardised test performance scores for math and reading. The information presented will determine school budgets and priorities decisions. 

## Overview of Project
Here is the list of deliverables for the analysis of the school district:

A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format

Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
School performance based on the budget per student
School performance based on the school size
