# School District Analysis

## Background
Maria, chief data scientist is responsible for analysing district schools tests data for students performance trends and patterns. These insights are used for informed decisions at the school and district levels. For this we are looking at the dataset to get an understanding of student fundings and standardised test performance scores for math and reading. The information presented will determine school budgets and priorities decisions.

Note: FERPA 1974 protects students' privacy.

## Overview of Project
Here is the list of deliverables for the analysis of the school district:

* A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
* An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format

Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
* Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
* The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
* The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
* School performance based on the budget per student
* School performance based on the school size
* School performance based on the type of school


### Purpose

## Analysis And Challenges

## Methodology: Analytics Paradigm

#### 1. Decomposing the Ask
To get the codes working faster and more elegantly with less traversal of the dataset.

#### 2. Identify the Datasource
Same dataset is used.

#### 3. Define Strategy & Metrics
Look at the current code and visualise the calls and routines to refine and reduce data calls.
Store data into arrays.

#### 4. Data Retrieval Plan
Use stock analysis dataset in Excel

#### 5. Assemble & Clean the Data
Excel VBA scripting

#### 6. Analyse for Trends
Compare timer from old codes with new codes

#### 7. Acknowledging Limitations
* Unable test out the new codes with a much larger dataset for a dry-run.
* Using VBA, the scripts will run in real-time.

#### 8. Making the Call:
The "Proper" Conclusion is indicated below on [Results](#results)
